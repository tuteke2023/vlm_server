- **Code Cleanup**: Removed 55 duplicate files, freed 2.88 MB
- **Response Caching**: Eliminates redundant processing
- **VRAM Management**: Automatic cleanup at 75% threshold

### 5. ✅ UI/UX Improvements (Completed)
- **Unified Interface**: Single, beautiful interface as default
- **Provider Switching**: Seamless toggle between local and OpenAI
- **Privacy Controls**: Automatic warnings for sensitive data
- **Modern Design**: Block-based layout with hover effects
- **Fixed Issues**:
  - White-on-white button visibility
  - Privacy modal positioning
  - Prompt updating across modes
  - Audio service link correction
