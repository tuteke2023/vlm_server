# Increment 5: VLM Server Endpoints - Summary

## Overview
Successfully updated the VLM server to integrate the unified LangChain system created in previous increments.

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Added New Endpoints
- `/api/v1/bank_extract_langchain` - Bank extraction using LangChain with structured output
- `/api/v1/generate_unified` - Text generation using unified provider
- `/api/v1/providers_unified` - List available providers
- `/api/v1/switch_provider_unified` - Switch between providers

### 2. Fixed JSON Parsing Issues
- VLM was generating JSON with arithmetic expressions in totals (e.g., "total_debits": 1500.00 + 67.89 + ...)
- Implemented regex-based solution to evaluate expressions before parsing
- Added fallback parsing strategies (manual JSON extraction, fixing parser)

### 3. Integration Points
- Initialized UnifiedLLMProvider and LangChainExtractor in VLMServer.__init__
- Added metadata to responses showing provider, model, and extraction method
- Maintained backward compatibility with legacy endpoints

### 4. Test Results
All tests passing:
- Server info endpoint working
- LangChain extraction successful with both local VLM and OpenAI
- Provider switching functional
- Unified endpoints operational
- Legacy endpoints still working

### 5. Real-World Testing
Tested with actual bank statement image:
- Successfully extracted 8 transactions
- Identified bank name and statement period
- Calculated totals (though debit/credit assignment needs refinement)
- Both LangChain and legacy methods produced results

## Known Issues

1. **Debit/Credit Assignment**: The LangChain extraction sometimes confuses debits and credits. This is a prompt engineering issue that can be addressed in the next increment.

2. **Opening Balance**: VLM sometimes treats opening balance as a debit transaction instead of just a balance.

## Benefits Achieved

1. **Structured Output**: LangChain's Pydantic models ensure consistent output format
2. **Better Error Handling**: Multiple fallback strategies for parsing
3. **Provider Flexibility**: Easy switching between local VLM and OpenAI
4. **Unified Interface**: Single codebase handles multiple LLM providers

## Next Steps

- Increment 6: Consolidate frontend code to use new endpoints
- Increment 7: Performance optimization and cleanup
- Address debit/credit assignment accuracy through better prompts
