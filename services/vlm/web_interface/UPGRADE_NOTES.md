# Web Interface Upgrade Notes

## Unified Interface Now Default (August 2025)

The beautiful, block-based unified interface is now the default web UI.

### What Changed:
- `index_unified_styled.html` → `index.html` (main interface)
- `app_unified_styled.js` → `app.js` (main JavaScript)
- Old files backed up as `.bak` files

### Key Features of Unified Interface:
1. **Provider Switching**: Toggle between Local VLM and OpenAI GPT-4V
2. **Privacy Controls**: Automatic warning when switching to OpenAI
3. **Beautiful UI**: Modern block-based design with hover effects
4. **Unified API**: Single codebase for all providers

### URLs:
- Main interface: http://localhost:8080/ (or http://localhost:8080/index.html)
- No longer need to use: http://localhost:8080/index_unified_styled.html

### For Developers:
- All new features should use the unified API client
- Test with both providers before deploying
- The old interfaces are kept as backups but shouldn't be used

### Cleanup:
The following files can be safely removed if no longer needed:
- `index_original.html.bak`
- `app_original.js.bak`
- `index_unified.html`
- `index_unified_styled.html`
- `app_unified.js`
- `app_unified_styled.js`
