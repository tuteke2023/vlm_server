     # Manual Testing Checklist for Unified LangChain Implementation
     ## Pre-Testing Setup
     - [ ] Ensure virtual environment is activated: `source ~/pytorch-env/bin/activate`
     - [ ] Start VLM server: `python services/vlm/vlm_server.py`
     - [ ] Start web interface: `cd services/vlm/web_interface && python server.py`
     - [ ] Verify `.env` file contains valid OpenAI API key (if testing OpenAI)

● Summary

  I've successfully created a comprehensive test suite for the unified LangChain implementation. Here's what was created:

  Test Files Created:

  1. Unit Tests:
    - test_unified_llm_provider.py - Tests for UnifiedLLMProvider including provider switching, message conversion, fallback mechanisms, and sensitive content detection
    - test_langchain_extractor.py - Tests for LangChainExtractor including LLM wrapper, extraction logic, validation, and chain composition
  2. Integration Tests:
    - test_bank_extraction_integration.py - Tests for the complete extraction pipeline, API endpoints, provider comparisons, and error handling
  3. E2E Tests:
    - test_web_ui_e2e.py - Selenium-based tests for UI interactions, provider switching, privacy warnings, and user workflows
  4. Performance Tests:
    - test_performance.py - Performance benchmarks, concurrent request handling, memory/CPU monitoring, and scalability tests
    - test_validation.py - Extraction accuracy validation, data integrity checks, edge case handling, and quality scoring
  5. Test Data:
    - sample_bank_statement.txt - Sample bank statement in text format
    - sample_bank_statement_expected.json - Expected JSON output
    - sample_bank_statement_expected.csv - Expected CSV output
    - edge_cases.json - Collection of edge case scenarios
  6. Test Infrastructure:
    - pytest.ini - pytest configuration with markers, coverage settings, and test paths
    - requirements-test.txt - All test dependencies
    - run_tests.py - Convenient test runner script
    - README.md - Comprehensive test documentation
    - MANUAL_TESTING_CHECKLIST.md - Detailed manual testing procedures

  Key Features of the Test Suite:

  1. Comprehensive Coverage: Tests cover unit, integration, E2E, performance, and validation aspects
  2. Mock Support: Extensive use of mocks to test components in isolation
  3. Async Testing: Full support for testing async operations
  4. Performance Metrics: Automated performance benchmarking and reporting
  5. Validation Framework: Robust accuracy validation against expected outputs
  6. Manual Testing: Detailed checklist for manual QA procedures
  7. CI/CD Ready: Configuration supports continuous integration workflows

  Next Steps:

  These test files are ready to be used once the actual implementation is complete. The tests are designed to:
  - Guide the implementation through TDD
  - Ensure quality and accuracy
  - Catch regressions early
  - Validate performance requirements
  - Support both automated and manual testing workflows

  The test suite provides a solid foundation for implementing and validating the unified LangChain solution.
